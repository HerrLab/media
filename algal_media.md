BBM & EBBM: for isolating photobionts and algae from BSC; this is a revised media protocol from other BBM protocols
	To make the stock solutions:
	Soln. #		Chemical	Weight		Vol. ddH2O
	Solution 1:	K2HPO4	1.875 g		250 mL
	Solution 2:	KH2PO4	4.375 g		250 mL
	Solution 3:	MgSO4-7H2O	1.875 g		250 mL
	Solution 4:	NaNO3		12.5 g		500 mL
	Solution 5	CaCl2-2H2O	0.625 g		250 mL
	Solution 6:	NaCl		0.625 g		250 mL
	Solution 7:	EDTA-Na4	5.0 g		100 mL
	Solution 8:	KOH		3.1 g		100 mL
Solution 9:	FeSO4-7H2O	0.498 g		100 mL
		H2SO4 (1.84 g/ 1 mL) add 100 uL
	Solution 10:	ZnSO4-7H2O	0.353g		25 mL
	Solution 11:	MnCL2-4H2O	0.058g		25 mL
	Solution 12:	CuSO4-5H2O	0.063 g		25 mL
	Solution 13:	Co(NO3)2-6H2O 0.20 g		25 mL
	Solution 14:	Na2MoO4-2H2O 0.048 g	25 mL
	Use recipes for vitamin mix and trace elements that are explained above for our lab
	*For longevity of the stock solutions it is advised that you autoclave them, however you can use them without autoclaving but they will only last about 3 months before expiring*
BBM: to make 1 L of media:
1.	Fill a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask with 940 mL of ddH2O
2.	Add 10 mL of solutions 1-6 to the flask
3.	Add 1 mL (1000 uL) of solutions 7, 8, 9 to the flask
4.	Add 100 uL of solutions 10-14 to the flask
5.	If making solid media add 15g of agar to the media
6.	Autoclave on P1 (less time liquid autoclave setting)
EBBM:
Do the same steps as above and:
1.	Add 30 mL of solution #4 instead of 10 mL
2.	Add 1 mL of Trace elements to the flask
3.	Add 1 mL of Vitamin mix to the flask
Cyanobacteria: fixes N2 from the air so to differentiate cyanobacteria from algae do this
Leave out Solution #4 of EBBM recipe
