5.  Pour approximately 30 mL per plate.

PDA odered before was Fisher #DF0013176

### Mung Bean Agar (MBA)

Used for _Fusarium_ spore production on culture plates.  Protocol developed by the lab of Dr. Ruth Dill-Macky.

| Ingredient | Amount |
|:----------------:|:-----------------:|
| | |

1.  Boil water in 2 L beaker.
2.  Place beans in water and boil for 25 min.
NOTE:  Time from when the water has returned to the boil.  The beans will have started to crack open by 25 min (this may happen as early as 15 min).  Good spore production is dependent on a cooking time of 25 minutes.
3.  Remove bean broth from heat.
4.  Mark 1 liter volume on the side of a 2-liter Erlenmeyer flask.
5.  Place a large Buchner funnel on the flask.
6.  Line the funnel using two gauze pads (4-6 layers of cheesecloth may be substituted). Ensure that the gauze/cheesecloth covers the funnel holes.
7.  Pour the bean broth slowly into the flask through the funnel
8.  Discard the beans (and gauze) from the funnel
9.  Soak the funnel and beaker in water
NOTE:  The residue is difficult to remove once dried onto surfaces!
10. Adjust the total volume of broth up to 1 liter by adding distilled water to the mark on the flask
11. Add 15 grams of agar (Fisher # BP1423-500) and mix.
12. Autoclave at 115 oC for 20 minutes, fluid setting
13. Cool in a water bath to ~50°C.
14. Pour ~30 mL per plate.

### V8 Juice Agar

Used for sporulation of some fungi and oomycetes

| Ingredient | Amount |
|:----------------:|:-----------------:|
| V8 Juice | 163 ml (1 can?) |
| CaCO3 | 1.8 grams |
| Agar | 15 g |
| deionized water | add up to 905 ml (should be 742ml diH20) |

1. Mix and heat to dissolve all ingredients;
2. Autoclave, cool, and pour

### Malt Extract Agar + Benlate + chloramphenicol

For isolation of wood decay fungi

| Ingredient | Amount |
|:----------------:|:-----------------:|
| | |

20g Malt Extract
15 g Agar
0.200 g chloramphenicol
1 L deionized water Mix and heat to dissolve all ingredients.
Autoclave, and cool to pouring temperature. After autoclaving, just before pouring add:
Benlate (10 mg/L) as 1mL of a 10 mg/mL stock suspension
(0.200g Benlate in 20mL 70% EtOH stock solution)

### MAG

Malt Extract Agar (1 L)
		To 960 mL of ddH2O add:
		Dextrose 	20 g
		Malt Extract	20 g
		Peptone	2 g
		Vitamin mix	1 mL
		Trace elements	1 mL
		Add 15 g of agar for solid media
	Autoclave on P2, or the second longest liquid autoclave time (30 mins vacuum)
	* For MEA, leave out the vitamin mix and the trace elements *

### YPD

Yeast Peptone Dextrose Agar
	To 960 mL of ddH2O add:
	Bacto yeast extract	10 g
	Bacto Peptone		20 g
	Dextrose		20 g
	Agar (for solid media)	20 g
	*  It is suggested that when adding dextrose to media that you autoclave the dextrose separately from the media, in this case you would add the 20 g of Dextrose to 50 mL of ddH2O and remove 50 mL of ddH2O to the media recipe. After autoclaving the dextrose and the rest of the media just pour the dextrose into the larger flask*


## LIQUID MEDIA

### Hillman Broth Media

| Ingredient | Amount |
|:----------------:|:-----------------:|
| yeast extract | 2% |
| dextrose | 5% |
| sucrose | 10% |
| malt | 4% |
| distilled water | 1 Liter |

### Mung Bean Broth (MBB)

Good for _Fusarium_ spore production in liquid culture.

| Ingredient | Amount |
|:----------------:|:-----------------:|
| | |

1.  Bring 1 L distilled H2O to a boil.
2.  Remove from heat and allow to sit 30 seconds.
3.  Add 40 g of mung beans and allow to steep 10 minutes.
4.  Fix a Buchner funnel to a 2 L flask and cover the holes with cheesecloth.  Filter the beans from the broth.
5.  Divide the broth as needed into flasks and put a sponge cork in the top.
6.  Autoclave 20 minutes on the fluid setting.
7.  Allow broth to cool overnight before inoculating.

## VITAMINS & TRACE ELEMENT ADDITIONS

### Vitamin Mix

To 100 mL of ddH2O, add 10 mg of each of the following:
		Biotin
		Pyridoxin
		Thiamine
		Riboflavin
		P-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)
		Nicotinic acid
Store in the dark (wrapped in aluminum foil) at 4°C

		ZnSO4 – 7H2O		2.2 g
		H3BO3			1.1 g
		MnCl2 – 4H2O		0.5 g
		FeSO4 – 7H2O		0.5 g
		CoCL2 – 6H2O		0.17 g
